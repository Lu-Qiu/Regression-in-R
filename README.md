This seminar introduces some fundamental topics in regression analysis using R in three parts. The first part begins with a brief overview of R environment and the simple and multiple regression using R. The second part introduces regression diagnostics such as checking for normality of residuals, unusual and influential data, homoscedasticity and multicollinearity. The third part of this seminar introduces categorical variables in R and interpret regression analysis with categorical predictor. 

In this seminar, I used a data file that was created by randomly sampling 400 elementary schools from the California Department of Educationâ€™s API (Academic Performance Index) 2000 dataset. This data file contains a measure of school academic performance as well as other attributes of the elementary schools, such as class size, enrollment, socioeconomic status, etc.

The data file needed for this seminar is elemapi2v2, which can be downloaded by clicking the following link:
